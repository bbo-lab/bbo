    """
    Computes the shortest path over multiple timepoints using a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
    This function finds an optimal trajectory based on a given distance matrix and a
    transition cost matrix penalizing switches between the different paths.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    distances : np.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape (num_timepoints, num_paths) where each entry represents
        the distance at a given timepoint for a particular path. NaN values indicate missing data.

    transitionmatrix : np.ndarray, str, or float, optional (default=None)
        Defines the cost of transitioning between different paths at each time step.
        - If "triangle", a transition matrix is created where transitions are only allowed
          between the current path and all previous paths (lower triangular matrix with zeroes).
        - If a numeric value, a full transition matrix is created with the given value as
          the transition cost, except for the diagonal, which remains zero (no self-transition cost).
        - If a 2D NumPy array, it is used directly as the transition matrix.
        - If None, no transition cost is applied.

    Returns:
    --------
    trajectory_indices : np.ndarray
        A 1D NumPy array of length `num_timepoints`, representing the indices of the optimal
        path at each timepoint.
